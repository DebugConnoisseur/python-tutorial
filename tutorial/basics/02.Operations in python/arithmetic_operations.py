#---------------------------------------------------------------- Arithmetic Operations------------------------------------------------

''' 
No, no. We are not talking about those operations at hospitals. 

We're talking about arithmetic operations in python, operations like addition, subtraction.

So how do you use those operations in python? That's what we're going to answer today

So first, make yourself familiar with these guys : +,-,*,/,//,%, **.

Wait, I thought you knew about them. Let me tell you what they are.

+ ---> Addition (or concatenation as we call it in python)
- ---> Subtraction
* ---> Multiplication (or Replication)
/ ---> Division
// --> Floor division (no, we are not dividing the floor, it just removes the decimal and gives us the nearest non decimal number)
% ---> Modulus 
** --> Exponentiation (just your powers)

Let us now apply these in our programs

'''
#Addition
print(3+5)

#Subtraction 
print(3-5)

#Multiplication
print(3*5)

#Division
print(4/8)

#Floor Division
print(3//5)

#Modulus
print(3%5)

#Exponentiation
print(3**5)

'''
That's it, simple as that.

That's it for arithmetic operators, it's your turn to try them out now.
