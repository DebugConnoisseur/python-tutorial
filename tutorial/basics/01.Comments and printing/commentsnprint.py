#----------------------------------------------------Comments and Printing--------------------------------------------------------------
#This is the beginning of the python tutorial

#---------------------------------------------------Comments----------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''In python, we write comments using hash or "#"
# is used for single line comments.

Comments are ignored by python and are used for documentation purposes.

Triple quotation marks such as the one used for this description is used for multiline comments.'''

#---------------------------------------------------Printing------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'''
Python probably has the easiest print statement. It's just a single line and is pretty straightforward.

Let us now try to print the number 2.
'''
print(2)

'''
See? It's just one line.

Ok, now we've printed a number but what about the famous Hello World that almost every tutorial has? You might have that question and we're going to come to it now.
'''
print("Hello World")

''' 
See? Simple, it's just one line too but you must've noticed that I've used quotation marks in this print statement.
Ask why? It's because the number 2 is an integer whereas Hello World is not a variable and is not defined (we'll come to the 'defining variable part soon).
So if you write print(Hello World) without the quotes, you would get an error. 
So to counter this, we use the quotes. 

Python uses the syntax --> print("enter the stuff you want to print") as the print statement

In print statement, you can either use single quotation marks or double quotation marks  

For integers, it's print(enter the number) , without any quotation marks.
