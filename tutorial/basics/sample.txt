Hey reader, looks like you're interested in learning python. 

Glad you're here. You made a good choice. 

This tutorial is designed to help newbies understand the language of Python. It's not some difficult language like Mandarin or... wait wait, wrong world. It's not some difficult or complex language like java or something else. 

Python is pretty much a straightforward programming language. You type some English keywords, give some logic to the program and the program delivers the output with a chef's kiss.

That's pretty much it. 

Basic python is very easy and it doesn't take too long to master it but python has a wide range of library support so it can make things harder if you want to try some advanced stuff.

Well, you might have a question.

If python is this easy, is it worth learning it?

Absolutely! Python is easy but don't underestimate its capabilities. Python is capable of many things, right from creating websites to developing AI.

Talking about AI, Python has become famous in the recent times solely because of what it can achieve with AI.

Python's existence dates all the way back to 1991. 

And the jesus of Python's world is Guido Van Rossum, the guy who developed Python. Python is being updated to this day and is becoming a lot more easier to use with each passing day.

Ok, enough talking. 

Time to enter the python world, rookie.
